# onlinemagazine

## Description:
The first project during my studies at Business Academy Aarhus, Multimedia Design programme. Individual.<br>
The brief was to create an online magazine revolving around one of interests, write our own articles and produce the media for it (photos, illustrations, etc.).
<br>
I developed it using only HTML and CSS, as it was just the beginning of my coding journey. 
Even so I'm still very proud of it even after all this time.
